I really enjoyed Richard III. I thought it was a fantastic performance of Richard III. 

You could tell how much was put into this performance. In the guidebook, they talked about how they went to great lengths to replicate the materials and making of the garments. They really focused on the details, and that made all the difference. 

The actor that played Richard was simply wonderful. You could tell how he really engaged with the audience, pulling them right into the play, forcing all your attention on him. Just wonderful. When he came on stage he carried himself just as I would have imagined Richard would: Loud and obnoxious. The actor knew how to capture the audience. He knew Richard in and out. 

While it was long, it was still a pleasure to sit and watch this play.
