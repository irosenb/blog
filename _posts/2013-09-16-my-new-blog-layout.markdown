I am super excited to present my new blog layout! I've been working on this since [August](https://github.com/irosenb/irosenb.github.io/commit/3406b8a66cb8fd5a241d24fd318bcfb012635193) when I got fed up with Octopress. It was extremely unflexible, and very irritating to use. 

I've found that barebones Jekyll is actually way easier to use that Octopress. Shocking, right? I remember having trouble pushing to Github because I had to first pull from Github in my `site` directory. It was absurd. 

But anyway, I'd love feedback. This is only the beginning of an upward journey.
