Over the summer, I had one of the most emotional moments in my life. It was the day that I felt like I finally had found a home.

I’ve had a physical home since I was born. And I have had my loving parents and brother, and we all get along quite well, but I never had anyone to share my passions with. My family doesn’t really understand what I do as a developer. I can show them all kinds of projects, and yet there is still something that doesn't really click.

But they can understand that Twitter and Facebook are shaping the world around them. They get the “what” part to technology. But they’ll never get the “why” part. 

I love programming. I remember one of the first programs I ever built, a word search game. I still marvel at what I achieved. In about three months I had built something that I, along with many others, loved to play. And people thanked me for it. It was a gratifying and deeply satisfying experience. 

I also love how as programmers, we can break down complex and abstract ideas into bite sized tasks. Over the summer I was working on a website with a friend of mine, and we planned out how we were going to work on it using a web service called Trello. You make cards, which are tasks you want to complete, and you put them into lists, which signal whether you have it as to-do, doing, or done. It’s a very iterative process, and I started realizing how effective it was. Because while we may not know what the end product will look like, we do know that the sign-up form is still not working, or that a link is broken.

Programming isn’t just about getting a “job,” or becoming the next Zuckerberg. It’s a way of life. We build the world we live in. We find and fix our problems. Our extreme optimism and conviction that we can change the world leads to us actually changing the world.

This summer I was an intern at a startup called The Flatiron School. What we do is take people with little to no programming experience, and turn them into full-time developers over 12 weeks. Sometimes I was doing mundane intern tasks, like organizing receipts. But most of the time, I was programming. Since the place is so small (12 employees, 32 students), people are mostly self-sufficient, which lets me focus on programming. It's really great to talk to adults who come from all kinds of backgrounds, but who have all ended up here because they wanted a change. During my time at Flatiron I talked to a former professional baseball player, who dazzled me by making comparisons between programming and playing baseball. I also talked to someone who had been in the military, and then joined a hardware startup. These stories are just some of the myriad lives that people had before ending up at The Flatiron School. 

This is the first time that I have been around people who truly believe what I believe. Who I can talk to about what excites me and they will just get it. No need for layers of abstraction.
