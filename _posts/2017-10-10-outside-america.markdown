I've been traveling abroad for almost 5 months now, and I wanted to put some thoughts together on traveling in the 21st Century.

Back a few decades ago, when you traveled outside your country, you were gone. Calling friends back home was expensive and difficult, if not impossible, and news from your home country was not readily accessible. 

Fast forward today, and we have everything at our fingertips. Friends, news, everything. Nowadays, you're never really "away", so to speak. Being on Facebook and Twitter I still have as much access to my friends and family as I did when I was back home.

I left America partly to get away from the crazy and never ending news cycle of this Trump Administration. As it turns out, you can't really leave. 

It shows up all over Twitter. Friends talk about it on Facebook. 

Even after I deleted the News app, and stopped looking at the news for some time, I started looking again. All of it still goes on whether I look at it or not, and I feel an obligation to keep watching while it all goes down.

Thanks for reading. These are some thoughts I've had but haven't spent time to flesh out :)
