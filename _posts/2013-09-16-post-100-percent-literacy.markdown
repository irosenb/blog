I was watching a Salman Kahn [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiKrFcgVSIU&feature=player_embedded) about his prediction of the next 50 years, and it was fascinating. One of the things he said that struck me was the idea of reaching near a 100% literacy rate worldwide. 

And so I wondered, if everyone is literate, what's next? What next goal as a human race are we going to aim for next? 

### 100% Creativity

By the time we will have reached 100% literacy, the industrial models of the 1800s will likely be marginalized in society. Without having to think about optimizing for machines or manual labor, we can devote our attention to maximizing creativity. 

That's exciting.
