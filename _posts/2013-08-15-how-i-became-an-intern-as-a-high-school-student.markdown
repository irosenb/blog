I saw Tess Rinearson's [post][1] on getting an internship as a high school student. And since I have an internship (which is almost over :() as a high school student I though I'd share my experience getting an internship as well.

> It's not that simple in high school. It can seem like companies don't want high school students, or, if they do, they're hiring just for "cups and coffee"

It's absolutely true, and a lot of people are confused by that. My dad said I should prepare to be getting cups of coffee and doing paperwork and whatnot. And sometimes I did do that, but that was quite rare. Most of the time I was working on real things, actually programming. 

And I loved it. 

It was really a home for me. 

But anyway, I should explain how I actually got it.

Rewind back to early March (I think), and I was looking on [Meetup.com][2] to go to some programming event. I really wanted to actually be programming, but doing it at home was not much fun. So I found a perfect meetup called Open Hack. It was being hosted at The Flatiron School. 

So I went. And it was awesome. I wanted to install a newer version of Ruby, and Avi helped me out. 

I went twice to the meetup, and both times were great.

Around May, I saw a tweet about Flatiron School doing a high school program. I was ecstatic. I talked to my parents about it, who were freaked out at the price tag. So I asked Avi if we could work something out. Like an internship or something. 

A few weeks later, he said I could join as an intern.

And that's the story.

But stories aren't fun told by themselves. There has to be lessons learned.
