I seriously had no idea how much I would miss my girlfriend. 

I had always been very present-oriented, not worried about what would happen when my girlfriend left for three weeks.

But now that she's not actually here, I *really* miss her. It's fine though, she's coming back this Sunday. Really really excited. 

I am [doing](http://flatironschool.com) other things to keep me occupied, and I love them. It's really been awesome to be interning here at The Flatiron School. 

But when I'm not at Flatiron I don't have much to do. 

I guess I really do have to be doing things, otherwise I'm just going to go lose my mind. 

I don't want to get too abstracted away from the days where I had nothing to do. No life, no love, just me sitting in my room feeling pretty lost. I do remember them, and now it seems kind of far away.

But those days are approaching. I am starting my senior year in high school (bleh). And I am really **not** looking forward to it. I'm still unsure about how people actually survive without passion, love, etc. All of that is there in high school. It's such an ugly place.
