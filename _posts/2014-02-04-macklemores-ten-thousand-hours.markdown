Macklemore is a master of poetry and rhythm, and he knows how to blend the two into a beautiful song. The result is *Ten Thousand Hours*, inspired by Malcom Gladwell's book, Outliers, which mentions that 10,000 hours of dedicated practice are required in order to become an expert in any given field. *Ten Thousand Hours* documents Macklemore's journey to success as he puts in his own 10,000 hours. It is filled with his struggles and triumphs, and that is what makes this poetry. Poetry, I believe, strips out the unnecessary details to get to what really matters: the raw emotions. *Ten Thousand Hours* satisfies this condition, and therefore I consider it to be poetry.
