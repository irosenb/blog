Recently I've been re-reading Paul Graham's articles. A quote from [one of his articles](http://paulgraham.com/love.html) resonated with me: 

> Are you dropping out, or boldly carving a new path? You often can't tell yourself. Plenty of people who will later do great things seem to be disappointments early on, when they're trying to find their niche.

I've been trying to figure this out myself. Because I certainly don't feel like I've been accomplishing much. I don't have a job in San Francisco, perhaps the most expensive city in the country. 

People are often puzzled by that. Every company in San Francisco is looking for developers, how could you not have a job? 

Basically, I haven't been producing enough. I feel like I've been going to too many meetups. But that's [changing](http://www.irosenb.com) for me. [MapHunt](http://maphunt.me) has been a surprising [success](https://twitter.com/irosenb/status/537801868072980480).

Looking back on the progress I've made is a great reminder that I haven't just been slacking. But it's also a reminder that there's so much more to be done. 

### Friends

In San Francisco I'm surrounded by people who are my age, and are also trying to make it in tech. It's amazing to be hanging out with some of the most brilliant people on Earth. 

At the same time, it's hard not to feel alone in this. Looking at these people it feels like they have all their shit together (of course chances are they don't). 

### Afraid

I haven't talked much about this stuff. A Twitter [conversation](https://twitter.com/irosenb/status/531301623432110081) made me feel much better but besides that, it's all been stuck in my head. 

I've just been afraid to talk about it. How are people going to react? Will they look at me in shame? I don't know. 

All I know is that I need to just put this out there and see what happens.
