I just published a [post]({% post_url 2014-03-21-18-years %}) which I had found unpublished from 6 months ago. 

Go read it, then come back here. 

I'll wait.

Since then, I've moved out to San Francisco. I've been able to experience being "on my own" for a little while now. 

I must say that surprised me how similar it is being on my own. Forgetting about high school, I still act, panic, and do everything the same as before.
